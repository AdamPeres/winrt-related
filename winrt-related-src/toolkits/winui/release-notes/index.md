# Windows UI Library Release Notes

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is an open source project hosted on GitHub. All new releases are built from the [Windows UI Library GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/winui). 

We also welcome bug reports, feature requests and community code contributions in the [Windows UI Library repo](https://aka.ms/winui).

WinUI includes two NuGet packages:

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml): Controls and Fluent Design for UWP apps. This is the main WinUI package.

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct): Low-level APIs for use in middleware components.

You can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) for more information.
