# Windows UI Library Release Notes

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is an open source project hosted on GitHub. All new releases are built from the [Windows UI Library GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/winui). 

We also welcome bug reports, feature requests and community code contributions in the [Windows UI Library repo](https://aka.ms/winui).

WinUI includes two NuGet packages:

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml): Controls and Fluent Design for UWP apps. This is the main WinUI package.

* [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Core.Direct): Low-level APIs for use in middleware components.

You can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) for more information.

## Examples

The Xaml Controls Gallery sample app includes interactive demos and sample code for using WinUI controls.

* Install the XAML Controls Gallery app from the [Microsoft Store](
https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt)

* The Xaml Controls Gallery is also [open source on GitHub](
https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery)

## Documentation

How-to articles for Windows UI Library controls are included with the [Universal Windows Platform controls documentation](/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/).

API reference docs are located here: [Windows UI Library APIs](/uwp/api/overview/winui/).
