# Extension APIs for Windows 10 devices
This topic lists the Win32 and COM APIs that are part of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and that are implemented by some Windows 10 devices, so your calls to these APIs must be guarded with conditions that first confirm the presence of the API on the device your app is running on. The union of [APIs present on all Windows 10 devices](win32-apis.md) and the APIs listed in this topic make up the entire Win32 and COM surface area of UWP.

This topic lists the APIs grouped by module (where the module is either an [API set](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/mt683763.aspx#api_sets) or a dll). For delay load, use the module name.
